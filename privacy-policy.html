               <br />
               <br />
               We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the
               following applies: (i) You have given their consent for one or
               more specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may
               be allowed to process information until you object to such
               processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or
               any other of the following legal bases below. This, however, does
               not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is
               subject to European data protection law; (ii) Provision of
               information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with
               you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (ii)
               Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
               which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that
               is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
               official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for
               the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a
               third party. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the
               specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in
               particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory
               or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter
               into a contract.
               <br />
               <br />
               Information transfer and storage <br />
               <br />
               Depending on your location, data transfers may involve
               transferring and storing your information in a country other than
               your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of
               information transfers to a country outside the European Union or

               UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your
               information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out
               more by checking the relevant sections of this document or
               inquire with us using the information provided in the contact
               section.
               <br />
               <br />
               The rights of users <br />
               <br />
               You may exercise certain rights regarding your information
               processed by us. In particular, you have the right to do the
               following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you
               have previously given your consent to the processing of your
               information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing
               of your information if the processing is carried out on a legal
               basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if
               information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding
               certain aspects of the processing and obtain a copy of the
               information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to
               verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to be
               updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain
               circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in
               which case, we will not process your information for any purpose
               other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain
               circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information
               from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in
               a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if
               technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another
               controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable
               provided that your information is processed by automated means
               and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract
               which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.
               <br />
               <br />
               The right to object to processing <br />
               <br />
               Where Personal Information is processed for a public interest, in
               the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the
               purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may
               object to such processing by providing a ground related to your
               particular situation to justify the objection. You must know
               that, however, should your Personal Information be processed for
               direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at
               any time without providing any justification. To learn, whether
               we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing
               purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this
               document.
